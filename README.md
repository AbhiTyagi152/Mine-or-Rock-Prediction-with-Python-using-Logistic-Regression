# Mine-or-Rock-Prediction-with-Python-using-Logistic-Regression
The project involves using logistic regression in Python to predict whether a sonar signal reflects from a rock or a mine. The dataset used in the project contains features that represent sonar signals, and the corresponding labels indicate whether the signals reflect from a rock or a mine.
The project begins with data preprocessing, including data exploration, handling missing values, and data visualization. Then, the dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation. Next, a logistic regression model is trained using the training set. The logistic regression model is chosen due to its ability to perform binary classification tasks, such as predicting rocks or mines in this case.
